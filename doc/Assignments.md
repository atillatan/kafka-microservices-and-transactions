# Problem Statement

There is a scenario where thousands of trades are flowing into one store, assume any way of transmission of trades (could be receiving the trades via Kafka or MQ orâ€¦).

We need to create a one trade store, which stores the trade (any kind of database) in the following order:


| Trade Id | Version | Counter-Party Id | Book-Id | Maturity Date | Created Date | Expired |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| T1       | 1       | CP-1             | B1      | 20/05/2020    | today date   | N       |
| T2       | 2       | CP-2             | B1      | 20/05/2021    | today date   | N       |
| T2       | 1       | CP-1             | B1      | 20/05/2021    | 14/03/2015   | N       |
| T3       | 3       | CP-3             | B2      | 20/05/2014    | today date   | Y       |


**Application to be created:**

1. Producer
1. Consumer
1. Validation to be applied  
1. Junit test Case to be written on Components
1. Architecture document
